## 📈 Data Engineering Maturity: The 3 Stages

| Stage | Name | Focus | Data Engineer's Role |
|-------|------|-------|----------------------|
| **1** | Getting Started | Build foundation | Architecture, data collection, deliver quick wins |
| **2** | Scaling with Data | Grow infrastructure | Automate, enable ML, scale systems |
| **3** | Leading with Data | Maximize value | Governance, collaboration, self-service |

## 🧬 Type A vs. Type B Data Engineers

| Type | Meaning | Focus | Tools |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| **A** | Abstraction | Simplification, reuse | Off-the-shelf, managed services |
| **B** | Build | Customization, scaling | Internal frameworks, bespoke pipelines |

## 🔄 Internal vs. External-Facing Data Engineers

- **Internal-Facing:** Serve analysts, scientists, BI dashboards
- **External-Facing:** Power consumer apps, manage concurrency, secure feedback loop
- **Reality:** Many engineers do both

## 🔁 Who Data Engineers Work With

### 🔼 Upstream Stakeholders:
- **Data Architects** – Design org-wide architecture and governance
- **Software Engineers** – Generate application data
- **DevOps/SREs** – Monitor, deploy, maintain data ops

### 🔽 Downstream Stakeholders:
- **Data Scientists** – Build predictive models, require clean and ready data
- **Data Analysts** – Query trends, KPIs; rely on semantic consistency
- **ML Engineers / AI Researchers** – Scale ML infra, overlap with DE/DS roles

---

## 👔 Business & Executive Interaction

- **CEO/CIO/CTO/CDO/CAO** – All increasingly involved in data platform strategy
- **Product Managers** – Define data products and feature value
- **Project Managers** – Coordinate sprint planning, delivery cycles
- **Other Managers** – DEs may work as centralized teams or embedded units

## 💼 Business Responsibilities of a Data Engineer

1. Communicate across tech & non-tech teams
2. Scope business needs & translate to data solutions
3. Understand cultural aspects of Agile, DevOps, DataOps
4. Monitor and control costs (TCO, opportunity cost)
5. Continuously learn and filter out hype
