| **Stage 1** | **Getting Started with Data** | Organization is just beginning its data journey. Manual and ad hoc processes.     | - Get buy-in from executives  <br>- Design initial data architecture  <br>- Identify key data sources  <br>- Build data foundations  <br>- Deliver early wins  | - Lack of quick wins  <br>- Working in silos  <br>- Reinventing the wheel                       |
| **Stage 2** | **Scaling with Data**         | Formal practices are in place. Focus is on scale, automation, and reliability.     | - Establish formal data practices  <br>- Build scalable architectures  <br>- Adopt DevOps/DataOps  <br>- Enable ML pipelines  <br>- Customize only when it adds value | - Blindly adopting trendy tech  <br>- Bottlenecks are people, not systems  <br>- Over-focusing on tech |
| **Stage 3** | **Leading with Data**         | Organization is data-driven. Self-service and data culture are in place.           | - Automate new data onboarding  <br>- Build data tools for competitive edge  <br>- Focus on governance and quality  <br>- Deploy data catalogs/lineage tools  <br>- Promote cross-team collaboration | - Complacency after success  <br>- Wasting time on non-impactful tech hobbies                   |
